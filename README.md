# Kattis Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various problems from [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/). Kattis is an online platform that hosts competitive programming contests and problems.

## Structure
- Each solution is organized in its own directory, named after a general topic.
- Inside each directory will be source code files (e.g. `solution.py`) with comments including my explanations of the approach and any notes related to the solution.
- You can find the problems themselves at Open Kattis by removing the file extension and appending the filename to the end of `https://open.kattis.com/problems/`, e.g., `https://open.kattis.com/problems/solution`

## Usage
Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as references.
